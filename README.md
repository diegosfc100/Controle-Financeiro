## Project
To make the records, the user must inform the name and value of each income or expense. All records are added to a list of transactions that contains the name, value and a side label that changes color according to the record, if it is revenue, the label is green and if it is an expense, the label is red.

For each record, the current balance is balanced. Revenues are added to the current balance and the total amount of “Revenues”, while expenses are subtracted from the current balance and added to the total amount of “Expenses”.

All records are stored in the browser's localStorage, so they remain saved even if the page is reloaded. To delete a record, just move the mouse over it in the list of transactions and a button appears in the left corner to remove it, after deletion, the balance of the current balance, income and expenses will be redone without accounting for the deleted record.
